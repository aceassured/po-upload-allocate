# po-upload-allocate
A Flask web app that extracts item data from uploaded PO PDFs, lets users allocate requested quantities, and distribute items into up to three boxes. It then generates per-box summaries and QR codes encoding JSON payloads (box number, items, totals) for efficient warehouse scanning.
